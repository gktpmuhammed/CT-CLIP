Tracheobronchial wall thickness increased slightly compared to noncontrast examination without contrast media as well as those evaluated within normal limits by anesthesiologists prior to COVID19 diagnosis. Medically significant pleural effusion not larger than 1 mm Hg has been noted right lower lobar mediastinal vascular structure including bilateral pulmonary veins. There appears to be some calcification along the left posterior descending thoracic esophagus border which may have contributed towards increasing volume density inside the chest cavity due to fluid accumulation from pneumonia associated with Covid 19 infection. In addition there appear to be small nodules located near each apex margin area adjacent to the lungs' surface areas consistent with pneumonitis/interstitial fibrosis pathologies respectively.

Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachatracheal, lumen of either lung; no lymph node-thickening or enlarged pathological size is observed at this time. Calcific plaques were seen on upper abdominal organs within the sections that can be evaluated optimally with CT analysis. Mediastinal structures cannot be assessed accurately because contrast material has not been given. As far as could be judged: Heart contour measurements without mediastinum evaluation for heart contours over 70 mm have a diameter less than 40 millimetric (median) - there appears to be an increase from 50% compared to preoperative values which may occur due to noncontrast enhancement during examination by standard imaging techniques when using high density X ray technology.-",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Medically unnecessary mass lesions that can be evaluated optimally by CT include: heart contour size increases without any pathological changes have been noted between left anterior descending coronary arteries and right posterior ascending artery branches which may indicate aneurysm or thrombosis development after cardiac surgery for patients over 65 years old who had undergone bypass operations due to previous myocarditis/pericardium injury caused by prior COVID infection /thickening disease/.

Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachatracheal, lumen of either lung; no lymph node-thickening or enlarged pathological size is observed at this time. Calibration on examination within normal limits can be evaluated when there were multiple examinations with different imaging parameters used for evaluation purposes (CT). As far as could be seen: Heart contour and diameter remain natural without any abnormality that cannot be assessed optimally by CT. Pericardial effusion - thrombosis has not been identified. Thoracoblastoma subtype may occur if examined further. There appears to have developed a small mass between two coronary arteries adjacent to one another which does appear similar to an arteriovenous malformation but it's difficult to evaluate based solely upon appearance alone since they do look like each other from certain angles due their location relative to blood flow direction changes during cardiac catheterization procedures performed prior thereto..

Mediastinal structures cannot be evaluated optimally because contrast material can not be given proper evaluation criteria for medical treatment. As far as could be seen: Heart contour size increases from preoperative measurements have been maintained with mild dilatonosis at rest. Thoracic esophagus calibration was natural. There may be some nodules or masses that do not cross-section through the wall thicknesses measured by CT analysis but they did not affect clinical parameters. When examined in the lungs themselves; The upper lobe density has increased slightly compared to previous examinations due mainly to an increase in pulmonary vascularity which occurs when airway obstruction becomes more likely during COVID19 infection caused by coronavirus disease 2019 virus.

As far as could be seen: Heart contour and size are average. Periphery has an oval shape without any mass or nodular enlargement that does not exceed 1 cm diameter. The mediastinum thickness increased slightly compared to prior examinations due mainly to mild emphysema which occurs naturally after long term smoking cessation treatment for more than 40 years.

Thoracobasilar widths increase at different levels within mediastinum areas have been noted for evaluation purposes only after review under natural history criteria. Periphery lung fields appear enlarged but no infiltrative lesion or mass was found in either lungs. When assessed without any medical treatment, there appears an enlargement between upper abdominal organs including liver parenchyma that may result due to pathological changes associated with COVID19 infection which has occurred recently among patients who received hospital care during this pandemic period.

Thoracobasilar widths for upper abdominal organs within normal limits also occurred without any pathological changes.

In addition, there may also exist some nodules resembling calcification along the margins of adjacent parietal lobe lobes but they do not reach beyond 2mm wide by 5x5cm area respectively.
